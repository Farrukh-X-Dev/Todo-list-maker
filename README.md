# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple, clean, and responsive to-do list web app. It allows users to add, delete, and persist tasks using local storage.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface with a modern, soft design and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the core functionality 

---

## 🎯 Motive

This project was built to demonstrate how core JavaScript can be used to:
- Dynamically manipulate the DOM (`createTodo`, `delTodo`)
- Persist user data using `localStorage` (so tasks are not lost on refresh)
- Practice event handling and input validation (`addTodo` method ignores empty tasks)
- Build interactive UIs without frameworks

If you'd like to:
- Improve UI/UX
- Add features like edit, sort, or dark mode

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or save the HTML file
2. Open it in any browser
3. Add your tasks and see them persist even after refresh!
